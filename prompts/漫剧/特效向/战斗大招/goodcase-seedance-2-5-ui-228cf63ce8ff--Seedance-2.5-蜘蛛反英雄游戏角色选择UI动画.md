## 提示词（English）

```text
title: "Spider Roster — Character Select Showcase"
reference_handling: "@image1 is the LOCKED SCENE COMPOSITION — replicate its exact game-menu layout in every frame: top nav bar (HOME / CHARACTERS / LOADOUTS / SETTINGS / PROFILE) with CHARACTERS highlighted teal, currency counters top-right, horizontal character-card carousel on the left half, LOADOUT icon row and SKILL TREE node graph bottom-left, SELECT / CUSTOMIZE / BACK buttons bottom-right, and the full-body 3D character standing on a glossy white showroom floor on the right half. @image2, @image3, @image4, @image5, @image6 are STRICTLY character design references — silhouette, armor geometry, color, emblem, materials ONLY. DO NOT reproduce their reference poses. DO NOT show any character standing flat-frontal with arms hanging limp at the sides. DO NOT reproduce the isolated cream/white empty backdrop from the character references — every character stands inside the game UI on the reflective floor. DO NOT place loose crystals, rubble blocks, or scattered debris props on the floor. Poses are dictated by the storyboard below."
style: "Stylized AAA game menu render. Faceted low-poly painterly hero models, Arcane-adjacent gouache shading, clean flat-white UI chrome. Crisp 4K."
visual_feel: "Locked, stable, showroom-clean. Smooth free-flowing character motion with weight and follow-through. Soft floor reflections, gentle bloom on emissive emblems, fine paper grain on armor plates."
duration: "20 seconds"
character_modeling:
ui_screen:
base: "Game character-select interface matching @image1. Cool near-white background, faint vertical light streaks behind the character stage."
features: "Five rounded rectangular character cards in a horizontal row on the left. The centered card is enlarged, elevated, white, with a downward pointer tab. Flanking cards are smaller, semi-transparent, and clipped at frame edge. Active card shows character portrait, NAME in bold black caps, class subtitle, and four stat rows: ARMOR / MOBILITY / HEALTH / POWER with colored values."
behavior: "The card row slides horizontally to bring the next character to center. Cards scale up on centering, scale down on leaving. Skill-tree nodes pulse once per swap. UI chrome, nav bar, and buttons NEVER move, warp, or reflow."
chaos:
base: "Spider-vigilante matching @image6 for design only."
features: "Cracked bone-white skull mask, glowing violet slit eyes, coral-red open coat, navy-and-red webbed bodysuit with a red spider emblem, cream sash knotted at the waist, chunky violet hex-tech gauntlets with glowing white hexagon and dot faces, orange skull kneepad, bandage-wrapped sandals."
movement_in_this_scene: "Loose, cocky, gambler energy. He never stands still — weight shifts, shoulders roll. NEVER shown with one foot propped on a stone block."
scrap:
base: "Spider-vigilante matching @image4 for design only."
features: "Pointed coral-pink hood-mask with a red spider face marking and black eye slits, layered violet scrap-cloth poncho with a red spider decal on the shoulder, burnt-orange wrapped tunic, crossed lavender strap harness, bandaged forearms and shins, a heavy violet six-barrel rotary cannon mounted on the right arm."
movement_in_this_scene: "Grounded, heavy, scavenger swagger. NEVER shown with the cannon lowered and idle at his side."
arcane:
base: "Spider-enforcer matching @image2 for design only."
features: "Angular lavender crystal armor with hairline gold fracture-web etching, sharp faceted hood over a dark deep-violet face with glowing white-violet eyes, oversized star-shaped crystal pauldrons, a blazing amber-gold spider emblem on the chest, deep maroon tabard, jagged crystal greaves."
power_this_scene: "Loose violet crystal shards materialize from thin air and orbit his hand, then align and hover."
movement_in_this_scene: "Controlled, ceremonial, unhurried. NEVER shown in the flat frontal deity-display stance from the reference."
pyre:
base: "Spider-enforcer matching @image5 for design only."
features: "Lilac faceted plate armor covered in fine white rune script, spiked pauldrons and vambraces, a smooth insect-like helm with pale orange lenses, a molten orange-gold spider emblem burning through the chest plate, live flame licking from the helm crest and neck seam, dark maroon underlayer."
power_this_scene: "Flame intensity rises and falls with his motion — brightest at the peak of a strike, guttering low when he settles."
movement_in_this_scene: "Explosive and martial. NEVER shown standing symmetrically with both arms hanging down."
shard:
base: "Spider-vigilante matching @image3 for design only."
features: "Dark charcoal-violet mask with large pale-pink lenses and thin web lines, black webbed bodysuit with a glowing violet spider emblem on the chest, the entire outer suit rendered as pale lavender-white crystalline fragments mid-dissolve, the left arm fully disintegrated into billowing violet particle flame, magenta gloved fingertips."
power_this_scene: "His body scatters into drifting shard particles and reassembles a short distance away."
movement_in_this_scene: "Weightless, drifting, unstable. NEVER shown standing upright with both feet planted flat."
cinematic_storyboard:
00_04_chaos:
camera: "Static locked-off full-screen UI. Hold."
action: "The card row is already settled on the CHAOS card, centered and enlarged, reading CHAOS / SPIDER-VIGILANTE with ARMOR HIGH, MOBILITY HIGH, HEALTH LOW, POWER MAX. On the stage, CHAOS flicks a glowing white hex-die off his right gauntlet, catches it blind behind his back with the left, then snaps both gauntlets up into a crossed X in front of his mask. The hex faces flare white. He rolls one shoulder, tilts his head, and drops into a loose one-hip idle sway, coat swinging."
lighting: "Even soft showroom key. Violet gauntlet glow spills onto his chest and mask."
sfx: "Two soft ceramic die-clicks. A low hex-charge hum on the flare."
04_08_scrap:
camera: "Imperceptible slow push-in toward the character stage."
action: "The card row shuttles one step left. The SCRAP card scales up to center, stats resolving to ARMOR MED, MOBILITY MED, HEALTH HIGH, POWER HIGH. SCRAP drops into a wide braced stance, plants his left foot, and spins up the rotary cannon — the six barrels rotate faster and faster, venting a puff of violet exhaust. He swings the arm in a slow horizontal sweep across the stage, then shoulders the cannon, rolls his neck once, and settles with the barrel resting high and the poncho still swaying."
lighting: "Soft key with a warm violet muzzle-glow kicking off his hood and strap harness."
sfx: "Card shuttle click-clack. Mechanical barrel spin-up whir. A soft pressure vent hiss."
08_12_arcane:
camera: "Locked-off full-screen UI. Hold."
action: "The card row shuttles left again. The ARCANE card centers, stats resolving to ARMOR HIGH, MOBILITY HIGH, HEALTH MED, POWER HIGH. ARCANE lifts his right hand palm-up. Seven violet crystal shards fade into existence and begin orbiting his fingers. He closes the hand into a fist and drives it down onto the floor — a ring of light travels outward across the reflective surface, the shards freeze in place mid-air, and the gold spider on his chest flares white-hot. He rises to a tall three-quarter stance, tabard settling, shards still hanging suspended around him."
lighting: "Cool key. Amber chest-emblem bounce warms his jaw. Violet rimlight from the orbiting shards."
vfx: "Shards materialize as flat painterly facets, never photoreal glass."
sfx: "Card shuttle click-clack. Crystalline chimes. A single deep resonant thud on the fist plant."
12_16_pyre:
camera: "Slow subtle arc to the right around the character stage."
action: "The card row shuttles left. The PYRE card centers, stats resolving to ARMOR HIGH, MOBILITY HIGH, HEALTH MED, POWER HIGH. PYRE drops to one knee and slams a palm flat to the floor — a column of orange flame erupts upward from the spider emblem burning through his chest plate. He sweeps his forearm in a wide burning arc, the fire trailing behind it in a smeared painterly ribbon, then rises into a bladed side-on guard, one fist cocked at the hip, flame guttering low at his helm crest."
lighting: "Warm orange firelight washes his lilac plates and throws a moving glow across the floor."
vfx: "Flame renders as stylized flat-shaped fire, not volumetric smoke."
sfx: "Card shuttle click-clack. A muted whoosh on the eruption. Low ember crackle underneath."
16_20_shard:
camera: "Slow, controlled pull-back to frame the full interface. Hold."
action: "The card row shuttles one final step left. The SHARD card centers, stats resolving to ARMOR MED, MOBILITY HIGH, HEALTH MED, POWER MAX. SHARD's body scatters into a burst of pale crystalline fragments and reassembles a full step to the right, landing low with two fingertips touching the floor. Violet particle flame pours off his dissolved left arm and drifts upward. He rises slowly, half-turns his masked head toward the lens, and holds — fragments still peeling off his shoulders and evaporating. The SELECT button pulses teal once. Hold on the frame."
lighting: "Cool white key. Violet particle glow underlights his chest emblem and mask lenses."
vfx: "Dissolve reads as flat painted shard shapes drifting off the silhouette, not smoke or embers."
sfx: "Card shuttle click-clack. A soft glass-scatter sweep on the teleport. One clean UI chime on the SELECT pulse."
production_notes:
audio_design: "Continuous low-tempo electronic menu loop underneath — soft synth pad, sparse pulse, no drums. Every card swap carries a short mechanical shuttle click-clack, like a rolling detent. Character sound effects stay restrained and diegetic: no impact booms, no orchestral hits, no risers. Music never swells; it holds one steady bed for all 20 seconds."
lighting: "Flat, even, high-key showroom lighting on the character stage throughout. Only each character's own emissive effects change the light. UI panels stay unaffected by character lighting."
critical_constraint: "@image1's interface layout is fixed for all 20 seconds — nav bar, currency counters, LOADOUT row, SKILL TREE graph, and SELECT / CUSTOMIZE / BACK buttons never shift position or change size. ONLY the card carousel slides and only the stage character changes. Each character stands in the same floor position, roughly centered in the right half. Character reference images supply design ONLY — no character is ever shown in the flat frontal arms-down reference pose, and no reference-image background props, crystals, rubble, or empty cream backdrop appear on the stage."
avoid: "Jitter, bent or distorted limbs, temporal flicker, identity drift between shots, chaotic composition, character frozen in reference-image pose, warping or garbled UI text, UI elements drifting or reflowing, camera shake."
